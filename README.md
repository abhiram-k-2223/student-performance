# Student Performance

## Introduction

This project involves preprocessing a dataset containing information about students' performance and applying linear regression to predict their overall scores. The dataset includes features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, type of lunch, test preparation course, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

## Objective

The primary objective is to preprocess the dataset by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features. Subsequently, a linear regression model is trained to predict the overall performance of students based on their demographic and academic characteristics.

## Components

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

- The dataset is loaded using the Pandas library.
- Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure and distribution of data.
- Information such as column names, shape, and value counts of categorical variables is obtained.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Categorical variables are encoded using custom label encoding methods to transform text labels into numerical representations.
- Two categorical features, namely gender and race/ethnicity, are encoded using a custom label encoder class.
- Numerical scores in math, reading, and writing are averaged to compute the total score, which serves as the target variable for regression.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- The dataset is split into features (independent variables) and the target variable (total score).
- Ordinal encoding is applied to three categorical features: parental level of education, type of lunch, and test preparation course.
- Ordinal encoding is implemented using a pipeline to ensure consistency and reproducibility in the transformation process.

### 4. Model Training

- A linear regression model is trained using the preprocessed features and target variable.
- The model is fitted to the training data using a pipeline that includes feature transformation and regression steps.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- The trained model's performance is assessed using test data to evaluate its ability to predict students' total scores.
- Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared may be used to quantify the model's accuracy.

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the data preprocessing and linear regression modeling approach employed in the project. By following the outlined steps, users can preprocess similar datasets and train predictive models to analyze students' academic performance. Additionally, this framework can be extended to incorporate more sophisticated feature engineering techniques and advanced regression algorithms for improved prediction accuracy.
